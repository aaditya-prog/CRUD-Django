**Hi there, I'm Aaditya Dulal.**

This is the first real project I've worked on and published on GitHub, It is
a simple CRUD application created using the powerful python framework, django.
Using the application, basic CRUD operations can be carried out.
User authentication system has also been managed in the application.
You must register and verify your email to login into the system.

So, if you are interested to take a look and run the project locally, follow the
guidelines below.

>For packaging and dependency management of the application, python poetry has
been used.

>Install poetry using the command `pip install poetry`. If you are facing
any problems installing and using poetry, read the docs here. [Poetry Docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

>Clone the repository or download it manually.
Inside the root directory of the project, there is an .env_example file.
Rename it to .env and change the database and email configurations.

>The default database used in the project is postgreSQL. If you wish to use any
other database, change the database settings manually. Visit the official django
documentation for the guide. [Django database settings](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#databases)

>Now go to your terminal, type `poetry run python manage.py runserver`,
poetry will automatically create a virtual environment on your system
and run the server. 

Thus, you're good to go. I'd be glad to help you and
receive your feedbacks on the project.
